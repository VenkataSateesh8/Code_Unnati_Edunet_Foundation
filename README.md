# Liver_Disease_Prediction_using_Logistic_Regression

Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to predict the presence of liver disease in patients based on various attributes. The goal is to provide an approach for liver disease diagnosis, enabling early intervention and better patient outcomes.

Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project is LIVER-PATIENT-DATA.csv.
It contains the following attributes:
1.	Age: Age of the patient.
2.	Gender: Gender of the patient (0: Female, 1: Male).
3.	Total_Bilirubin: Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
4.	Direct_Bilirubin: Direct bilirubin level in mg/dL.
5.	Alkaline_Phosphotase: Alkaline phosphatase level in IU/L.
6.	Alamine_Aminotransferase: Alamine aminotransferase level in IU/L.
7.	Aspartate_Aminotransferase: Aspartate aminotransferase level in IU/L.
8.	Total_Protiens: Total proteins level in g/dL.
9.	Albumin: Albumin level in g/dL.
10.	Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio: Ratio of albumin and globulin.
11.	Dataset: Class label indicating whether the patient is a liver patient (1) or a non-liver patient (2).

Files
1.	LIVER-PATIENT-DATA.csv: The dataset file containing patient data.
2.	Liver_Disease_Prediction_using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Scikit-learn

Usage
1.	Clone the repository or download the files.
2.	Open the Liver_Disease_Prediction_using_Logistic_Regression.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE.
3.	Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance.
4.	You can also modify the input data in the last cell of the notebook to predict whether a new patient has liver disease or not.

Results
The trained Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 70% on the testing data. The classification report and confusion matrix are also provided in the notebook for further evaluation.
